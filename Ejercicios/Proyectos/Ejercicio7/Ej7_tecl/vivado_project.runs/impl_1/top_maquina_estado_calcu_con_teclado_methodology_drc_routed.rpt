2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks CLK_10MHZ_WCLK and CLK_10MHZ_WCLK_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks CLK_10MHZ_WCLK] -to [get_clocks CLK_10MHZ_WCLK_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks CLK_10MHZ_WCLK_1 and CLK_10MHZ_WCLK are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks CLK_10MHZ_WCLK_1] -to [get_clocks CLK_10MHZ_WCLK]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[5] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[5]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[6] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[6]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch mode_calculadora/module_control/leds_rgb_control/rgb_o_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin mode_calculadora/module_control/leds_rgb_control/rgb_o_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#9 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch mode_calculadora/module_control/leds_rgb_control/rgb_o_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin mode_calculadora/module_control/leds_rgb_control/rgb_o_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#10 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch mode_calculadora/module_control/leds_rgb_control/rgb_o_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin mode_calculadora/module_control/leds_rgb_control/rgb_o_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
