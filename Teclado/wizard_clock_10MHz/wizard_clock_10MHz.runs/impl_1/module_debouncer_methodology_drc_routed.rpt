2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out10MHz_clk_wiz_10MHZ and clk_out10MHz_clk_wiz_10MHZ_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out10MHz_clk_wiz_10MHZ] -to [get_clocks clk_out10MHz_clk_wiz_10MHZ_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out10MHz_clk_wiz_10MHZ_1 and clk_out10MHz_clk_wiz_10MHZ are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out10MHz_clk_wiz_10MHZ_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out10MHz_clk_wiz_10MHZ]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ff1/Q_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ff2/Q_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
